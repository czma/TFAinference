* Convergence for all params = convergence? Or report for each individual param?
    - All parameters converging, adjust requirements
        Based on differential analysis -- if not affecting R^2, can't be learned -- fix them or exclude them from convergence
* Process for determining convergence of param:
    1. If the sign changes and the the absolute value of the difference between consecutive iterations is greater
       than the absolute limit (same as pseudocount?), parameter does not converge
    2. Otherwise, take the absolute pseudocounted log fold change between the parameters. If it's greater than the
       logarithmic limit (=1), the parameter does not converge


TODO:
    Plot absolute log fold change
    Finite derivatives of R^2 values -- not gene activities (recalculate incrementally?)
    Consider 2nd derivatives of parameters as well/instead? (differences between forward and backwards derivatives over 2* epsilon) CHECK THIS!!!
    Histogram of differences in variance explained differences in final iteration
        Separate for CS vs TFA
    Check whether best random restarts in terms of of R^2 converge with each other? # within epsilon of R^2?
